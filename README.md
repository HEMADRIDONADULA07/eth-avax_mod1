**HemadriContract - Readme**

This is the readme file for the HemadriContract. The contract contains a single function `division`, which performs a division operation with certain requirements and checks using `require`, `revert`, and `assert` functions.

**License**
The contract is licensed under the MIT License. Make sure to read and understand the terms of the license before using or modifying the code.

**Prerequisites**
- Solidity Compiler version 0.8.0 or compatible.

**Function Details**
The contract contains the following function:

1. `division(uint numerator, uint denominator)`: This function takes two parameters `numerator` and `denominator`, both of type `uint` (unsigned integer). It performs the division operation `numerator / denominator` and returns the result as a `uint`.

**Requirements and Checks**
The function contains the following requirements and checks:

1. `assert(denominator != 0)`: The `assert` function is used to validate that the `denominator` is not equal to zero. If `denominator` is zero, the function execution will be halted, and all state changes will be reverted.

2. `require(denominator > 5, "denominator should be greater than 5")`: The `require` function is used to check that the `denominator` is greater than 5. If the condition is not met, the function execution will be halted, and the specified error message will be provided as the reason for the revert.

**Error Handling**
1. `revert("Result is too large")`: After performing the division, the function checks if the result is greater than 1000. If the result is greater than 1000, the function will revert with the specified error message. Revert is used here to handle exceptional cases where the result is not within the desired range.

**Important Note**
- The contract uses Solidity version 0.8.0. Ensure that you use a compatible compiler to avoid compilation errors.
